 Lixie-SNTP-IPv6:
  A arduino sketch for a six digit Lixie US eastern time clock.
  The sketch uses the internet protocol version 6 (IPv6)
  SNTP client with a DS3231 real time clock.

 - Version 1.0
   = Initial version

 SNTP is a simple subset of the full NTP protocol.

 See RFC4330 for details of the protocol:
  - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4330

 This example demonstrates of the basics of an SNTP client;
 A real-world client should enforce RFC4330 properly, such as
 the randomized time before sending a query at startup.

 This example uses a static MAC address, please update the MAC with your
 own static MAC address.

 Libraries that are used in this sketch:
  -Lixie     : https://github.com/connornishijima/Lixie-arduino
   -= Dependencies:
      -== FastLED
  -Time      : http://playground.arduino.cc/code/time

 To Do:
  - Button to switch between 12 hour and 24 hour time formats.
  - Add display of calendar date.
  - Function when Ethernet not connected.
    -- Use RTC time.
  - Functions when DNS resolution fails.
    -- Use RTC time.

Why Did I Create this arduino sketch?

 I first created a Unix C program that ran on a raspberry pi that used the
 six Lixie digit displays. The Lixie use 20 WS2812/B/S RGB LEDs.The RGB LEDs
 are controlled by using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) controller. The C 
 library that I used for the raspberry pi's PWM was not stable. Every few
 minutes it would cause the clock to display the wrong color and digit. After
 failing to get the C library to work I decided to try using the Lixie-arduino
 arduino library.  
 
Quick Description of the Arduino Sketch Loop:

 The real time clock's , DS3231, time is what is displayed. NTP is used
 to update the real time clock. A NTP request is only send every 15 seconds.

 1. Did the device receive a NTP responses packet?
    a. No 
    b. Yes 
       - Get the time and date from the NTP responses packet.
       - Convert the NTP UTC time to US eastern time. 
       - Update the real time clock with the eastern time and date from the
         NTP responses packet. 

 2. Is it time to send a NTP request.
    a. No
    b. Yes
       - Send a NTP request.

 3. Get the current time from the real time clock.

 4. Display the current time on the Lixie displays.

 5. Wait half of second before the next loop.
